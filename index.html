                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>My name is Alex Collings, I'm a programmer who used to study Astrophysics, I enjoy working on anything related to games</p>
                    <p>I mainly program in C++, C#, and Python, but recently I've taken a liking to web development and have been working on learning more Javascript and JQuery</p>
                    <p>I have a few projects under my belt, and I'm always working on something, what I'm currently making is a mobile game mixture of a platformer and a fighting game, you can find some info about it in the 'PROGRAMMING' tab up above</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've also been working on my modelling and animation skills for the past year or so, you can see some of my work in the 'ANIMATION' tab above.</p>
                    <p>My models and animations aren't the best, but they're mainly just a hobby that I use for solo projects</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My other hobbies include TTRPGs, Snowboarding, and Reading</p>
